Background

Flight delays and cancellations are a serious problem faced by large and small airlines alike. 
In 2022, an airline could lose on average $101.18 per minute of a delayed flight (Airlines for America). 
This is particularly alarming for smaller airlines that rely heavily on smooth operations in order to remain profitable and relevant for their customers. 
It goes without saying that optimum arrival performance is critical for the economic success of airlines and satisfaction of their customers. 
That is why these airlines need the proper insight to improve performance, retain customers and attract new ones, and remain competitive in the industry.

Problem Statement
This analysis relies on different variables (operating airline unique carrier code, wheels on time, wheels off time, taxi out time, taxi in time, arrival time and departure time) to predict whether arrival delays are possible or not. 

Conclusion
Summary
Given the important features that were used to run the best model, it would be useful to re-run the model using a validation set. This could provide a more accurate evaluation of the best model. The models could also be improved by using additional relevant data for each airline that could provide more details and insight on how airlines’ operations are run. This could include but is not limited to ground staff data, maintenance schedules or types and number of repairs done. Finally, based on the precision and recall of the model, our final model had 83% precision rate and around 93% recall rate. This is considered to be a fair method to evaluate a model’s performance (Beheshti).
